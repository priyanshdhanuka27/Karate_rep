      <p id="about-para">Train full contact karate not only for the mat, but for life.
        Our classes are designed to develop the entire martial artist by focusing on three main aspects: kihons (basics), kata (forms) and kumite (sparring).
        <br><br>
        In addition to kihons, kata and kumite; we focus on developing the athleticism through conditioning the mind and body.
        <br><br>
        Be prepared to workout and sweat. Although each person’s needs will be taken into consideration, we design the classes to be rigorous and push you towards your physical and mental goals. Expect bruises and soreness. We fight full contact, using light pads for conditioning during training and practice functional self defense, if it doesn’t work, we won’t teach it.
        <br><br>
        Whether you want a good workout, to feel stronger or train to be a fighter; our classes are designed to help you discover you have what it takes.</p>

Every student should line up immediately. The instructor/senior student will lead the class through a bow before training.</p>
        <ul style="text-align: left !important;">

          <li>“Shinza ni rei” – Bow to show respect the shrine or organization.</li>
          <li>“Oyama ni rei” – Bow to show respect to Mas Oyama.</li>
          <li>“Mokusu” – Concentrate your breathing, close your eyes, and prepare for training.</li>
          <li>“Mokusu yame” – Stop and open your eyes.</li>
          <li>“Shihan ni rei” – Bow to show respect to the teacher of instructors.</li>
          <li>“Sensei ni rei” – Bow to show respect to the instructor.</li>
          <li>“Senpai ni rei” – Bow to show respect to senior students.</li>

        <p style="text-align: left !important;">When class ready to end the insctructor will call the class to line up and lead 
          either a formal or informal bow out. The formal bow out is essentially the same as the bow in, except that the 
          <a href="../oath/dojo_oath.html" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;">Dojo Oath </a>
          may be recited after everyone is in “Seiza”. The final command will be “Geiko yame, tatte kudasai”, 
          which indicates that everyone should stand up and class is over. From there the instructor will talk 
          about any pertinent announcements and then dismiss class. then dismiss class.</p>
